## Deployment on Vercel
This project is configured for easy deployment on Vercel as two separate projects (frontend and backend).

```Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.

Import Backend Project:

On Vercel, create a "New Project" and import your forked repository.

Set the Root Directory to backend.

Add your MONGO_URI and FRONTEND_URL as Environment Variables.

Deploy.

Import Frontend Project:

Create another "New Project" and import the same repository.

Set the Root Directory to frontend.

Add the VITE_API_URL environment variable, using your live backend's Vercel URL as the value.

Deploy.

Vercel will automatically handle CI/CD, redeploying your projects whenever you push a new commit.
```

## Self-Hosting with Docker
This project is fully containerized for easy self-hosting.

Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

Clone the repository.
In the root directory, run the following command:

```
docker-compose up --build 
```
This will build the combined application image and start the app and mongo services. Your entire application will be accessible at http://localhost:5001.
